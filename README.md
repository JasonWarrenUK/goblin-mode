**Goblin Mode** is a permanently-in-flux configuration system (~~slash commands~~[^1], skills, agents, hooks) built by one developer to solve problems they actually had. User skills trace back to a specific friction point. Hooks enforce habits that were being skipped.

[^1]: goddamit anthropic why did you deprecate these

- **Weakness-aware design:** Testing is a known weakness, so a dedicated skill encodes the discipline. ADHD makes executive function unreliable, so hooks enforce it instead of relying on willpower.
- **Context window discipline:** CLAUDE.md loads every session. Skill descriptions load at start; bodies lazy-load on trigger. Commands load on invocation. Agents run in sub-processes. Every layer has a deliberate cost.
- **Model tier thinking:** Commands specify whether they need Haiku (fast, cheap), Sonnet (balanced), or Opus (thorough). Not every task needs the biggest model.
- **Friction-driven, not architecture-driven:** This grew organically from actual work. The process of building it is what's transferable, not the specifics.

> [!NOTE]
> This setup is specific my workflow (and brain). If you're building your own, the **process** is what's transferable; the specifics should be yours.

## What's In Here

<details>
<summary><strike><em>THIS IS COMPLETELY OUT OF DATE INNIT</em></strike> This table represents an outdated state of the repo</summary>

```markdown
| Component | Count | What it does |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Commands** | 50+ | Slash commands you type (e.g. `/git:commit:one:delta`) |
| **Skills** | 12 | Knowledge packs that load automatically when relevant |
| **Agents** | 3 | Autonomous sub-processes for multi-step work |
| **Hooks** | 4 | Shell scripts that run on git events (push, commit) |
| **Docs** | 18 files | Guides, references, and workflow documentation |
```

## Quick Start

If you've cloned this and want to understand what you're looking at:

1. **Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md):** this is the main behaviour file. It tells Claude how to write code, format commits, and communicate.
2. **Browse [commands/README.md](commands/README.md):** the full index of slash commands, organised by category.
3. **Read [How to Use This Repo](docs/guides/HOW-TO-USE-THIS-REPO.md):** the comprehensive guide that explains every directory and the thinking behind each one.

If you're new to Claude Code customisation entirely, start with the [How to Use This Repo](docs/guides/HOW-TO-USE-THIS-REPO.md) guide. It assumes no prior knowledge of configuration beyond basic Claude Code usage.

## Directory Guide

### `CLAUDE.md`: The Behaviour File

The single most important file. This is loaded into every Claude Code session and defines:

- **Technical profile:** languages, frameworks, preferred tools
- **Communication rules:** British English, no sycophancy, direct answers
- **Code conventions:** tabs for indentation, naming patterns, TypeScript strict mode
- **Git workflow:** conventional commits, branch naming, PR structure
- **Security defaults:** no committed secrets, input validation, RLS

Think of it as "if I had to brief a new developer on how I work, what would I say?"

### `commands/`:  Slash Commands

Commands are workflows you invoke explicitly by typing `/command-name` in Claude Code. There are 50+ of them across 8 categories:

- **Codebase:** analyse, critique, investigate a project
- **Documentation:** create READMEs, roadmaps, ADRs, work records
- **Git:** commits, PRs, branch management, rebasing
- **Linear:** issue creation, task management, dependency tracking
- **Suggest:** "what should I work on next?"
- **Do:** "just do this thing, minimally"

Each command filename ends with a **model tier** (`delta`, `gamma`, `omega`) that signals which Claude model it's designed for:

| Tier | Model | Best for |
|------|-------|----------|
| `delta` | Haiku | Fast, routine tasks |
| `gamma` | Sonnet | Balanced reasoning |
| `omega` | Opus | Complex analysis |

Full reference: [commands/README.md](commands/README.md)

### `skills/`:  Domain Knowledge

Skills are **passive:** you don't invoke them directly. Claude loads them automatically when it detects relevant keywords in your conversation. For example, mentioning "Svelte" triggers the `svelte-ninja` skill, which loads Svelte 5 patterns and SvelteKit conventions.

Current skills cover: Svelte, Git, API design, CSS/styling, debugging, databases (SQL + graph), testing, and a few others.

Only the skill's short description loads at session start (cheap on context). The full knowledge pack loads on demand.

### `agents/`:  Autonomous Workflows

Agents are **sub-processes** that Claude spawns to handle multi-step work independently:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `project-context-loader` | Rebuilds mental context when switching between projects |
| `implementation-planner` | Breaks vague feature requests into actionable plans |
| `roadmap-maintainer` | Keeps documentation and roadmaps in sync with code changes |

They run in their own context window, so they don't clutter your main conversation.

### `hooks/`:  Git Automation

Shell scripts that run automatically on git events:

| Hook | Trigger | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `pre-push.zsh` | Before push | Routes to other hooks; guards which repos run the full chain |
| `pre-push-tests.zsh` | Before push | Detects untested files; runs test suite |
| `pre-push-evidence.zsh` | Before push | Extracts apprenticeship portfolio evidence from commits |
| `post-commit-docs.zsh` | After commit | Checks if changed files need documentation updates |

These are specific to an apprenticeship workflow; they enforce habits that are easy to forget (running tests, tracking evidence, updating docs).

### `docs/`:  Documentation

Guides, references, and workflow documentation. See the [full index](#documentation-index) below.

## How It All Fits Together

```
You type something in Claude Code
        │
        ├─ Keywords detected? ──→ Skill loads automatically
        │
        ├─ You type /command? ──→ Command runs a defined workflow
        │
        ├─ Command spawns agent? ──→ Agent works autonomously
        │
        └─ You push code? ──→ Hooks run checks and extraction

Meanwhile, CLAUDE.md shapes every response throughout.
```

The key insight: **CLAUDE.md is always active**, skills activate on context, commands activate on demand, and hooks activate on git events. Each layer has a different trigger and a different cost to your context window.

---

## Key Concepts

**Context window cost:** Everything Claude reads uses up its working memory. This setup is designed to be efficient: only descriptions load upfront, full content loads on demand. If you're building your own, this matters more than you'd think.

**Model tiers:** Not every task needs the most powerful model. Haiku is fast and cheap for routine work. Opus is thorough but slower and more expensive. The tier system makes this choice explicit.

**Organic growth:** None of this was planned upfront. Every command, skill, and hook traces back to a specific problem that came up during actual work. If you're building your own setup, start with one friction point and go from there.
